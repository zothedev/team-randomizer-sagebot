This program, while simple, was my first programming project back in 2020. A new team-based video game released and my friends and I were met with an issue that everyone dreads: picking between your friends. I decided to build a Discord (popular chat and voice service) bot that automatically reads the users in a voice chat and randomly divides the users into two teams. A simple ".gen" message in a Discord text chat would automatically display two teams, all users randomly split between the two for everyone to see. 

This program represents an issue that my friend group faced and me developing a seamless solution. This served as a great introduction to Python, the asyncio Python library, and training my brain to think like a programmer.
